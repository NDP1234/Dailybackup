Microservice Architecture

Needs of Microservice
1) It is self-contained.
2) Each microservice can be hosted on different servers.
3) Each microservice can be written in diffrent programming languages. 
4) They can have different databases.
5) If correction is required then after changing in corresponding microservice it solely rehosted instead of rehosting the whole project.  
6) Load balance.

steps:
1) client sends the request to api gateway. This request path is called as upstream path. because client has no direct access to api(Microservice).
2) Now API Gateway sends request to microservice. This request path is called as downstream path.
3) Once response is got by api gateway it passes to client.
