* Authentication: Identify the user

* Authorization: determine the access of that user

* Authentication handlers -> Authentication Services -> Authentication Middleware 

* Schemes:
The registered authentication handlers and their configuration options are called "schemes".

* Authentication Handler:
An authentication handler is a class, where we will define how to react to a specific scheme.
Is a type that implements the behavior of a scheme.

* Authentication Scheme:
The authentication scheme can select which authentication handler is responsible for generating the correct set of claims.
An authentication scheme is a definition of what is required for an authentication process. This includes the following:
1) The login module stack used to determine whether a user is granted access to an application.
2) The user interfaces used to gather the information required to authenticate a user.

* Authenticate:
An authentication scheme's authenticate action is responsible for constructing the user's identity based on request context.
It returns AuthenticateResult indicating weather authentication was succesful and if so, the user's identity in an authentication ticket.  
Authenticate example includes:
1) A cookie authentication scheme constructing the user's identity from cookies.
2) A JWT bearer scheme deserializing and validating a JWT bearer token to construct the user's identity.

* Challenge: (calls when try to access directly without login)
An authentication challenge is invoked by Authorization when an unauthenticated user requests an endpoint that requires authentication. 

-> Authentication challenge examples include.
1) A cookie authentication scheme redirecting the user to a login page.
2)A JWT bearer scheme returning a 401 result with a www-authenticate: bearer header.

* Forbid: (calls when user is logged in but requested resources is not permitted to him/her.)
An authentication scheme's forbid action is called by Authorization when an authenticated user attempts to access a resource they're not permitted to access. 

-> Authentication forbid examples include:
A cookie authentication scheme redirecting the user to a page indicating access was forbidden.
A JWT bearer scheme returning a 403 result.
A custom authentication scheme redirecting to a page where the user can request access to the resource.

-> A forbid action can let the user know:
They're authenticated.
They're not permitted to access the requested resource.

--------------------------------------------------------------Introduction to Identity----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* ASP .Net core Identity:
-> Is an API that supports user interface (UI) login functionality.
-> Manages users, passwords, profile data, roles, claims, tokens, email confirmation, and more.
->Identity is typically configured using a SQL Server database to store user names, passwords, and profile data. Alternatively, another persistent store can be used, for example, Azure Table Storage.
